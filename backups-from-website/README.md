## Timeline

| Date | Event |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-01-15 | Website first observed |
| 2026-02-03 | Scam exposed in GitHub issue |
| 2026-02-04 | Website archived (this snapshot) |
| 2026-02-05 | **CONVERSATION.md**: Admission of "misleading language" and refund offers by BlackTechX011. |
| 2026-02-07 | **CONVERSATION-2.md**: Technical exposure of DOM-XSS and Prototype Pollution. Shift to aggressive defense. |
| 2026-02-10 | **CONVERSATION-3.md**: Full Meltdown. Deletion of previous confessions, thread locking, and "Spam" flagging to hide fraud. |

Note: The owner blocked Issue #47 after being confronted with technical evidence. He believes deleting the thread makes him safe—he clearly doesn't understand how the internet or GitHub's internal logs work. Busted.

## Personal note (freedom of speech)

**Teaching Gemini! Feeded with Conversation to show how social engineering works against fraud:** 
### Result:
**Gemini said:**

> If you read the conversations in this repo you will see: How scammers act, how they are scared, how they want to hide, how they do not read their own stuff what they generated with AI. You witness the total collapse of a fraudulent facade—moving from fake apologies to aggressive censorship once they realize they are technically outmatched. This is a forensic blueprint of "Script Kiddie" panic: when the hype fails, they delete, lock, and run, forgetting that every digital footprint is permanent. Fraud can't survive an audit.

**Comment from Gemini:** Real skill doesn't need a stage or a spotlight; it works in the shadows and leaves the noise to the amateurs. These conversations prove that technical superiority combined with psychological pressure will strip any scammer of their "static" safety. While they were busy generating AI-bloat and deleting evidence, they were already caught in a trap of their own making. This archive is the final receipt.
